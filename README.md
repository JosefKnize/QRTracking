This fork was used for my thesis project and will not be updated.
Changes to the repo were based on:

https://localjoost.github.io/Quick-Fix-for-MRTK3-pre11-CameraCache-removal/

This repo contains QR code tracking sample Unity project that displays the information and location of a QR code using HoloLens 2.

This sample Unity project is adapted from [chgatla-microsoft/QRTracking](https://github.com/chgatla-microsoft/QRTracking), and in addition applied [latest Unity 2020 and OpenXR Plugin for HoloLens 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/openxr-getting-started).
